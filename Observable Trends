1.  In the scatterplot, it appears that the majority of tweets have a very nuetral score, with what appears to be an equal distribution of positive and negative tweets.
2. In the scatterplot, it appears the tweets that have a negative sentiment, on average, have a stronger sentiment than the tweets with a positive sentiment.
3.  In the bar chart, I found it interesting that Fox News was the only twitter account that wasn't in the negative, having a slightly positive average sentiment.
